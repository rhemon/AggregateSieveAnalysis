# AggregateSieveAnalysis

Simple android application that will do the very basic sieve analysis of aggregate for you as you provide the weight retained at particular sieves.

Personally I do not have enough knowledge on sieve analysis, therefore this application is open source, code available on github, open for change. Developers are welcomed to edit and bring a better and complete app for android.
