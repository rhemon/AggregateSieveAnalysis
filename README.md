# AggregateSieveAnalysis

Simple android application that will do the very basic sieve analysis of aggregate (finds fineness modulus and uniform coefficient) for you as you provide the weight retained at particular sieves.

Personally I do not have enough knowledge on sieve analysis, so it probably lacks lots of thing that should have been part of sieve analysis, therefore this application is open source,welcoming developers to edit and bring a better and complete app for android.

Here are few TODOs that I have kept for future:
1. Adding an option to export all data as pdf file, and also allowing to print it.
2. Giving an option to add other sieve no. on data entry.
3. Making the graph zoomable 
4. Making the view in TableFragment better
5. Making the unsaved change warning come only when there is change
6. Getting a better picture for app icon

There is a lot more things that can be done. Request to any one interesting on contributing to try completing some these TODOs. 
Thanks
